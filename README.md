# MacPro7-1-z97-Gaming-5
I have included a config.plist without SMBIOS information added as this is meant to be a personal repository for my own EFI for both backup purposes and for reference purposes for others. Do not use this for yourself, instead follow the Dortania install guide to make your own. It is not intended as a prebuilt EFI and WILL NOT WORK without substantial changes unless you have an identical hardware configuration to mine.

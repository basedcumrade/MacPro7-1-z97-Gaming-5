# MacPro7-1-z97-Gaming-5
I have included a config.plist without SMBIOS information added as this is meant to be a personal repository for my own EFI for both backup purposes and for reference purposes for others. Do not use this for yourself, instead follow the Dortania install guide to make your own. It is not intended as a prebuilt EFI and WILL NOT WORK without substantial changes unless you have an identical hardware configuration to mine. Even then, you will need to generate and add a proper MacPro7,1 SMBIOS and check over all of my work- I know I've done this correctly but YOU do not. It's simpler to just make your own. Please do it, it's fun! Here's a link to the Dortania guide: https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/
